"""
When the segments_intersect function is called with two copies of the same line segment, 
due to the nature of the checks involved (which are designed for distinct segments), 
it would typically return False, indicating no intersection, 
because the logic is not designed to handle the case of overlapping segments as "intersections" 
in the context it was intended for (checking between different segments for crossings).
