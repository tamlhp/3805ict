"""
To determine if two line segments are parallel without using division, you can use the concept of cross product in vector math. For two line segments defined by their endpoints (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) to (x4, y4), the segments are parallel if the vectors (x2-x1, y2-y1) and (x4-x3, y4-y3) are parallel.

The vectors are parallel if their cross product is zero. The cross product of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) is ad - bc. If the result is zero, it means the vectors are parallel.
