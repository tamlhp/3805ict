"""
The 2-approximation algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem is a simple, yet effective, greedy algorithm. 
The Vertex Cover problem is a classic example of a computational problem: given a graph, the goal is to 
find the minimum number of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in this set. 
This problem is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to find the optimal solution for all instances.

A 2-approximation algorithm doesn't guarantee finding the minimum vertex cover but ensures that the number of 
vertices in the cover is at most twice the optimal number. This is what "2-approximation" signifiesâ€”it provides 
a solution within a factor of 2 of the optimal solution.

"""
By including both u and v for each selected edge, the algorithm potentially doubles the count of vertices in the worst case, 
hence ensuring the size of the vertex cover found by the algorithm is at most twice the size of the optimal vertex cover.
